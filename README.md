# GestureControl

A Python-based gesture tracking system that allows users to define and customize their own gestures for intuitive human-computer interaction.

## Overview
The aim is to make GestureControl a flexible framework that captures and interprets hand movements through a camera, enabling users to control applications through personalized gestures. Currently working on customizability, allowing users to map their own intuitive gestures to specific actions.
Installation

Install the required dependencies: pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy.

## Future Plans
1. Create a larger library of pre-defined common gestures (Short term)
2. Create plugins for popular applications (media players, presentation software, browsers) (Short term)
3. Get a License and make this open-source to allow other users to integrate this as a library (Long term)
